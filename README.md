# Shopping-Website

The ejs file "store.ejs" saved in the folder "views" is a website showing some food items available to be bought.

The front end is simply developed using HTML CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

The backend uses Node.js and Express.js framework. The payment option is fully functional with the help of the Stripe RESTful Api.

An item from the store can be added to cart and removed from the cart. The total cost is displayed at the bottom beside the Pat Button.

The project demonstrates very simple application of RESTful api and backend using node and express.
